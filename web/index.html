    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    
    <font size="+2">
        Thank you for being part of our data collection. We are part of the Brown University Humans To Robots Laboratory under Principal Investigator Prof. Stefanie Tellex. Weâ€™re gathering natural language commands for completing household tasks in AI2-THOR, a virtual environment. 
A personal assistant robot has the ability to navigate to different landmarks in the environment and manipulate objects. It also has a camera, so it can perceive different items and qualities about its environment. We will show you how the robot operates in the environment (see the examples below)
Your task is to provide 15 separate natural language commands which instruct the robot to perform tasks that include manipulation, navigation, and perception. To be super clear, all three must be present in the commands. The tasks are limited to pick up/grab and place/drop tasks. Make sure the commands instruct the robot to move to different rooms.
