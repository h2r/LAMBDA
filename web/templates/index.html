    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    
    <font size="+2">
        Thank you for participating in our data collection. We are robotics researchers from Brown University. On the next page, you will write <b>15</b> unique natural language commands to a robot in 5 virtual household scenes, i.e., <b>3 commands per scene</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        A personal assistant robot can navigate to different places in the virtual environment, pick up and place objects. It perceives the environment with its camera. Please see a video below of how the robot operates in the environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        When giving commands, you should assume the robot starts in the same position in each scene. Each command is separate and should not refer to any previous command. Your commands must describe picking up and placing objects as well as moving in the environment. You can refer to only furniture, objects, and rooms that exist in the environment. Make sure your commands instruct the robot to move between rooms. You only need to give the commands, you do not need to actually perform the task, although you can if it helps you brainstorm. Do not limit your commands to what you think the robot might “understand”, rather <b>assume the robot is as intelligent as a human</b>. Examples of commands are shown below.
        <br>
        <br>
        Do <b>NOT</b> pick up/place the following objects in your commands, even if they exist in the scene. You can refer to them in relation to something, like “Pick up the bat next to the laptop." but not "Pick up the laptop.":
        <ul>
            <li>Laptop</li>
            <li>Desk</li>
            <li>Anything that can be turned on/opened</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lamp (sometimes labeled “floor” or “desk”)</li>
                    <li>TV</li>
                    <li>Drawers</li>   
                    <li>Faucet</li>
                    <li>Fridge</li>
                    <li>Etc.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <div class="iframe-container">
            <iframe id="myIframe" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-POxqTh2AedW-ZIYSGbPJQc3b3FDfcOL/preview"></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>“Go to the living room and grab the purple pillow that is on the couch, then go to the office and place it on the chair.”</li>
            <li>“Go to the living room and pick up the basketball next to the table, then go to the can and drop it inside.”</li>
            <li>“Go to the bedroom and grab my phone off the bed, then bring it back to me.”</li>
            <li>“Bring me the black TV remote on the table in the living room.”</li>
            <li>“Take the baseball bat next to you and move it to the desk in the bedroom”</li>
          </ul> 
        <h4>FAQ:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Can I command the robot to search for an object instead of telling the robot exactly where the object is? For example “Find the basketball and bring it back to me”.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A: No, please give clear instructions.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Q: Can I refer to specifics in the environment such in the commands such as the Vincent van Gogh painting on the wall?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A: Yes. Pretend the robot is as intelligent as a human and command it as you would a human.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Q: What objects can I pick up?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A: The labeled objects in the interactive window that a human can pick up with one hand. For example, the TV is labeled in the interactive window but it cannot be picked up by a human with one hand, and thus cannot be picked up by the robot.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Q: In the interactive window I see that the objects have labels when I point on them, can I refer to objects that do not have labels such as a desk</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A: Yes, as long as you are not telling the robot to pick up those objects. For example, you can tell the robot to place an object on a desk but cannot tell the robot to pick up the desk.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Q: Can I pick up an object and not place it? E.g. "Pick up the remote and wait near the sofa"?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A: No. Please place any object that is picked up.</li> 
                </ul>
        </ul>
